# SQL Languages
SQL Languages are those languages that allow the database users to read, modify, delete and store data in the database systems.

Following are the four different types of languages or commands which are widely used in SQL queries:
1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
3. DCL (Data Control Language)
4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)


### DDL (Data Definition Language) 
DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, alter, and manage database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. DDL statements are crucial for setting up and modifying the structure of a database.

#### Common DDL Statements
- CREATE: Defines a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or schema.
- ALTER: Modifies an existing database object.
- DROP: Deletes an existing database object.
- TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table but does not delete the table structure.
  
#### Additional DDL Concepts
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include:

- PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between tables.
- UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value.
- CHECK: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
