# SQL Languages
SQL Languages are those languages that allow the database users to read, modify, delete and store data in the database systems.

Following are the four different types of languages or commands which are widely used in SQL queries:
1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
3. DCL (Data Control Language)
4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)


# DDL (Data Definition Language) 
DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, alter, and manage database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. DDL statements are crucial for setting up and modifying the structure of a database.

#### Common DDL Statements
- CREATE: Defines a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or schema.
- ALTER: Modifies an existing database object.
- DROP: Deletes an existing database object.
- TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table but does not delete the table structure.
  
#### Additional DDL Concepts
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include:

- PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between tables.
- UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value.
- CHECK: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

# DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manage and manipulate data within database objects like tables. DML statements are essential for performing operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

#### Common DML Statements
- INSERT: Adds new records to a table.
- UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
- DELETE: Removes existing records from a table.
- SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

#### Additional DML Concepts
Transactions: DML operations can be grouped into transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit.

##### Transaction Control Statements:

- BEGIN TRANSACTION or START TRANSACTION: Begins a new transaction.
- COMMIT: Saves the changes made by the transaction.
- ROLLBACK: Reverts the changes made by the transaction.

# Data Control Language (DCL)
Data Control Language (DCL) is used to control access to data in the database. The two main DCL statements are:

- GRANT: Gives a user permission to perform certain actions on database objects.
- REVOKE: Removes a userâ€™s permission to perform certain actions on database objects.

# Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Transaction Control Language (TCL) manages the changes made by DML statements and allows you to group DML statements into transactions.

- COMMIT: Saves all the transactions to the database.
- ROLLBACK: Undoes the transactions that have not been saved to the database.
- SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can roll back later.
- SET TRANSACTION: Sets the characteristics of the transaction.

# Datatypes in SQL
### Numeric Data Types
#### 1. Integer Types:
  - TINYINT: A very small integer.
  - SMALLINT: A small integer.
  - MEDIUMINT: A medium-sized integer.
  - INT or INTEGER: A standard integer.
  - BIGINT: A large integer.
    
#### 2. Decimal Types:
  - DECIMAL(p, s) or NUMERIC(p, s): Fixed-point numbers with precision p and scale s.
  - FLOAT: A floating-point number.
  - DOUBLE: A double-precision floating-point number.
  - REAL: A floating-point number (implementation may vary between databases).

### Character (String) Data Types
#### 1. Fixed-Length Strings:
- CHAR(n): A fixed-length string of n characters.
#### 2. Variable-Length Strings:
- VARCHAR(n): A variable-length string with a maximum length of n characters.
- TEXT: A large text field (varying implementations like TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT).

### Date and Time Data Types
#### 1. Date:
- DATE: Stores a date (year, month, day).
#### 2. Time:
- TIME: Stores a time (hour, minute, second).
#### 3. Date and Time:
- DATETIME: Stores date and time information.
- TIMESTAMP: Stores a timestamp, usually in the format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. Can also track timezone changes and be used for automatic data recording.
#### 4. Year:
- YEAR: Stores a year in 2-digit or 4-digit format.

### Binary Data Types 
#### 1. Fixed-Length Binary Data:
- BINARY(n): A fixed-length binary string.
#### 2. Variable-Length Binary Data:
- VARBINARY(n): A variable-length binary string with a maximum length of n.
#### 3. Large Binary Data:
- BLOB: A binary large object (varying implementations like TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB).

### Miscellaneous Data Types
#### 1. Boolean:
- BOOLEAN or BOOL: Stores true or false values.
#### 2. Enumerated Types:
- ENUM: A string object that can have only one value, chosen from a list of permitted values.
#### 3. Set:
- SET: A string object that can have zero or more values, each of which must be chosen from a list of permitted values.
#### 4. Spatial Data Types:
- GEOMETRY: Stores geometric data.
- POINT: Stores a single point in space.
- LINESTRING: Stores a sequence of points to represent a line.
- POLYGON: Stores a polygon.
#### 5. JSON:
- JSON: Stores JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.

# Constraints in SQL
Constraints in SQL are rules enforced on data columns in a table to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Constraints define how data should be stored in the database, and they can be applied at the column level or the table level. Here are the primary types of constraints in SQL:
## Types of Constraints
1. NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
2. UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column or a set of columns are unique across the rows in the table.
3. PRIMARY KEY: A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. It uniquely identifies each row in a table.
4. FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity by linking two tables. The foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table.
5. CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
6. DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified.
7. INDEX: Improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage and slower write operations.

# Operators in SQL
SQL operators are used to perform operations on data and help in formulating queries. They can be broadly categorized into several types based on their functionality. Here's a overview of the different types of operators in SQL:
#### 1. Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations.
- Addition (+): SELECT 10 + 5;
- Subtraction (-): SELECT 15 - 5;
- Multiplication (*): SELECT 4 * 3;
- Division (/): SELECT 20 / 4;
- Modulus (%): SELECT 17 % 4;

#### 2. Comparison Operators: Compare values to return boolean results.
- Equal to (=): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary = 60000;
- Not equal to (<>): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary <> 60000;
- Greater than (>): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 60000;
- Less than (<): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary < 60000;
- Greater than or equal to (>=): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary >= 60000;
- Less than or equal to (<=): SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary <= 60000;

#### 3. Logical Operators: Combine conditions.
- AND: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000 AND Department = 'IT';
- OR: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000 OR Department = 'HR';
- NOT: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE NOT Department = 'IT';

#### 4. String Operators: Manipulate string data.
- LIKE: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName LIKE 'S%';
- CONCAT: SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName FROM Employees;
- SUBSTRING: SELECT SUBSTRING(FullName FROM 1 FOR 5) AS ShortName FROM Employees;

#### 5. Set Operators: Combine results from multiple queries.
- UNION: SELECT FirstName FROM Employees UNION SELECT FirstName FROM Managers;
- UNION ALL: SELECT FirstName FROM Employees UNION ALL SELECT FirstName FROM Managers;
- INTERSECT: SELECT FirstName FROM Employees INTERSECT SELECT FirstName FROM Managers;
- EXCEPT: SELECT FirstName FROM Employees EXCEPT SELECT FirstName FROM Managers;

#### 6. Null Operators: Handle NULL values.
- IS NULL: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE MiddleName IS NULL;
- IS NOT NULL: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE MiddleName IS NOT NULL;

#### 7. Conditional Operators: Provide conditional logic.
- CASE: SELECT FirstName, CASE WHEN Salary > 70000 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Low' END AS SalaryCategory FROM Employees;
- COALESCE: SELECT FirstName, COALESCE(MiddleName, 'N/A') FROM Employees;
- NULLIF: SELECT NULLIF(Salary, 50000) FROM Employees;

#### 8. Aggregate Functions: Calculate summary values from data sets.
- COUNT: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
- SUM: SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM Employees;
- AVG: SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees;
- MIN: SELECT MIN(Salary) FROM Employees;
- MAX: SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;
